# Recommender-System-from-scratch

Recommender System from scratch  using Apache Spark transformations and actions to implement MF using Stochastic Gradient Descent.

# A Matrix Factorization approach focuses on finding latent factors that are not necessarily apparent in the data.

In Linear Algebra, a matrix can be decomposed into multiple parts. Those parts can be recombined and this creates recommended “scores” for products not yet purchased. The main function which we will use in Spark for MatrixFactorization will be SGD. our dataset is movielens 100k. http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
